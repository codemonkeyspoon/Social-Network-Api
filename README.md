# Social-Network-Api

## Description

My challenge this week was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I also used Moment.js to format time. Since the application will not be deployed, testing and the video walkthrough were completed in Postman.

## User Story

AS A social media startup  
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database  
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data  

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API  
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application  
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database  
WHEN I open API GET routes in Postman for users and thoughts  
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON  
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Postman  
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database  
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Postman  
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
